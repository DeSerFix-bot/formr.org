# Psytests survey framework

## Component 1: Surveys

You can design simple surveys using this framework.

## Component 2: Runs

Simple surveys can be made into elaborate studies by using runs.

Runs allow you to:

* manage access and eligibility for a study and different pathways using branches
* send e-mail invites and reminders
* implement delays
* add external modules
* soon: loop surveys and thus enable diaries, experience-sampling studies etc.
* soon: give feedback based on user input (already primitively possible using branches)
