					Disclaimer
				</h4>
				<p> This is pretty much brand new software and is supplied for free, open-source. As such, it doesn't come with a warranty of any kind. Still, if you let us know when formr causes you trouble or headaches, we will try to help you resolve the problem and you will get our heartfelt apologies. If you're the technical type, you might consider hosting a stable release of formr yourself, because this version of formr tracks the most recent pre-release and will thus sometimes have kinks.</p>

					Features
				</h2>
				<h4>
					Good already:
				</h4>
				<ul class="fa-ul-more-padding">
					<li>
						does diary studies with automated reminders
					</li>
					<li>
						generates pretty feedback live, including <a href="http://ggplot2.org/">ggplot2</a>, <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lattice/">lattice</a> and <a href="http://rcharts.io/">rCharts</a> plots
					</li>
					<li>
						looks nice on your phone
					</li>
					<li>
						you can use R to do basically anything that R can do (complicated stuff!)
					</li>
					<li>
						manage access to and eligibility for studies
					</li>
					<li>
						longitudinal studies
					</li>
					<li>
						easily share, swap and combine surveys (they're simply spreadsheets with survey questions) and runs (so that you can share designs, e.g. "daily diary study" and higher-level components like filters and feedback)
					</li>
					<li>
						send text messages (see the <a href="https://github.com/rubenarslan/formr.org/wiki/How-to-send-text-messages-(SMS)">HowTo</a>)
					</li>
					<li>
						works on all somewhat modern devices and degrades gracefully where it doesn't
					</li>
					<li>
						formats text using <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/">Github-flavoured</a>  <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/">Markdown</a> (a.k.a. the easiest and least bothersome way to mark up text)
					</li>
					<li>
						file, image, video, sound uploads for users (as survey items) and admins (to supply study materials)
					</li>
					<li>
						complex conditional items
					</li>
					<li>
						a dedicated <a href="https://github.com/rubenarslan/formr/">formr R package</a>: makes pretty feedback graphs and complex run  logic even simpler. Simplifies data wrangling (importing, aggregating, simulating data from surveys).
					</li>
					<li>
						a nice editor, <a href="https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace">Ace</a>, for editing Markdown &amp; R in runs.
					</li>
					
				</ul>
				<h4>
					Plans:
				</h4>
				<ul class="fa-ul-more-padding">
					<li>
						work offline on mobile phones and other devices with intermittent internet access (in the meantime <a href="https://enketo.org/">enketo</a> is pretty good and free too, but geared towards humanitarian aid)
					</li>

					<li>
						a better API (some basics are there)
					</li>
					<li>
						social networks, round robin studies - at the moment they are a bit bothersome to implement, but possible. There is a dedicated module already which might also get released as open source if there's time. 
					</li>
					<li>
						more <a href="https://github.com/rubenarslan/formr.org/issues?labels=enhancement&page=1&state=open">planned enhancements on Github</a>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Where to get help</h4>
				<p>If you're a participant in one of the studies implemented in formr, please reach out to the person running the study.</p>
				<p>If you're running a study yourself, there's several places to look.<p>
				<ul class="fa-ul-more-padding">
					<li>
						this documentation is a good start, just click on any of the tabs above.
					</li>
					<li>
						There is a <a href="https://github.com/rubenarslan/formr.org/wiki">Wiki</a> on Github. You can find a number of HowTos there and contribute yourself.
