## ideas for example studies

### diary study
simply every other day diary study with invites and reminders

### storm study
users provide their location in the beginning and are invited, on a daily basis, if there was a lightning storm the previous day or night (linked with some weather app)

### longitudinal study

### study with external stuff?

### informant design

### complex feedback
